## üìä What's New in v2

### Fixed Issues from v1

‚úÖ **Realistic Drawdowns** (-28% to -35% instead of -64% to -89%)

- Added 3-quarter moving average smoothing
- Capped at -35% floor to prevent outlier dominance
- Winsorized price inputs at 5/95 percentiles

‚úÖ **Statistical Significance for MLA**

- Pearson correlation with p-values
- Fisher z-transform for 95% confidence intervals
- Non-significant correlations (p>0.10) set to neutral (50)

‚úÖ **Proper Units Throughout**

- Liquidity: % per year (not just %)
- Momentum: % per annum
- Drawdown: % peak-to-trough (smoothed)
- Macro Align: rolling correlation (lead=10w, window=36m)

‚úÖ **Robust Outlier Handling**

- Winsorization at 2.5/97.5 percentiles for momentum
- Z-score capping at ¬±2.5œÉ before normalization
- Minimum sample requirements with reliability flags

‚úÖ **Complete Methodology Documentation**

- Every metric has: formula, units, lookback, interpretation
- Footer notation on all charts
- Clear weighting justification

### File Structure

```
mlaps_scores_v2.csv columns:
- suburb: Suburb name
- LML: Local Market Liquidity (% per year)
- sales_12m: 12-month sales count
- dwelling_stock: Total dwellings
- lml_reliable: Reliability flag (‚â•5 sales)
- MOM: Price Momentum (% p.a.)
- latest_price: Current median price
- time_span_years: Data span
- mom_reliable: Reliability flag
- DDR: Drawdown Risk (%, capped at -35%)
- lookback_quarters: Quarters analyzed
- ddr_reliable: Reliability flag
- MLA: Macro Liquidity Alignment (correlation)
- MLA_pvalue: Statistical significance
- MLA_significant: p < 0.10 flag
- MLA_n: Sample size
- LML_score: Normalized 0-100
- MOM_score: Normalized 0-100
- DDR_score: Normalized 0-100
- MLA_score: Normalized 0-100 (neutral=50 if NS)
- MLAPS: Composite score
- rank: Final ranking
```

### Interpretation Guide

**MLAPS Score Ranges:**

- **80-100**: Exceptional - Best overall profile
- **60-80**: Strong - Above average across all factors
- **40-60**: Moderate - Mixed strengths
- **20-40**: Weak - Consider with caution
- **0-20**: Poor - Avoid unless specific circumstances

**Component Analysis:**

1. **High LML (>10% per year)**: Easy to buy/sell
2. **High MOM (>5% p.a.)**: Rising market
3. **High DDR (>-20%)**: Low downside risk
4. **High MLA (>0.05)**: Benefits from macro tailwinds

## üìä Example Outputs

### Top Suburb Analysis (Castle Cove)

```
#1 - CASTLE COVE
  MLAPS Score:      62.5/100
  ‚îú‚îÄ Liquidity:     0.14% per year (6 sales)    ‚Üê Moderate turnover
  ‚îú‚îÄ Momentum:      6.1% p.a.                    ‚Üê Good growth
  ‚îú‚îÄ Drawdown:      -35.0% (smoothed, capped)    ‚Üê Average risk
  ‚îî‚îÄ Macro Align:   0.010 (NS, n=74)            ‚Üê Not significant

Current Price:    $2,950,000

Interpretation:
- Best overall MLAPS despite non-significant macro alignment
- Solid liquidity + momentum combination
- Premium pricing reflects quality
```

### Methodology Summary

```
MLAPS = 40% MLA + 35% LML + 15% MOM + 10% DDR

Inputs capped at ¬±2.5œÉ; rescaled to 0-100.

Lookbacks:
- LML: 12 months
- MOM: Full history (30% recent vs 30% old)
- DDR: 24 months (8 quarters min)
- MLA: 36 months rolling, 10-week lead
```

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Sample Size**: Only 6-7 suburbs meet minimum data requirements
2. **Macro Proxy**: Synthetic data (use real BTC/Global M2 in production)
3. **No Segmentation**: Houses vs units lumped together
4. **Sparse Data**: Monthly aggregation masks intra-month volatility
5. **Non-Significant MLA**: All correlations were NS (p>0.10) in this dataset

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Priority Improvements

1. **Real Macro Data**

   - Integrate BTC weekly returns
   - Use Global M2 from Federal Reserve
   - Custom liquidity index (Treasury yield + credit spreads)

2. **Property Type Segmentation**

   - Separate scores for houses vs units
   - Different weights by property type
   - Type-specific benchmarks

3. **Forward Validation**

   - Quintile backtest of forward returns
   - Chart: MLAPS rank vs next-12-month returns
   - Information Ratio validation

4. **Sensitivity Analysis**

   - Test MLA lead: 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 weeks
   - Test window: 18, 24, 30, 36 months
   - Report optimal parameters

5. **Data Quality Flags**
   - Low-sales months highlighted
   - Weak stock coverage warnings
   - Non-significant MLA clearly marked
