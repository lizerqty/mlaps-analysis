## üé§ ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Be Honest!)

Already in quiz answers:

1. Sparse data (6 suburbs only)
2. Synthetic macro proxy (real BTC/M2 better)
3. No house/unit split
4. Historical patterns ‚â† guarantees
5. Outlier sensitive

**This shows maturity!** Assessors value honesty over perfection.
