# MLAPS: Macro-Liquidity Aligned Property Score

**Microburbs Analyst Coder Quiz - October 2025**

---

## üéØ Overview

MLAPS is a composite investment metric (0-100 scale) that ranks Australian residential property markets by combining four critical factors:

1. **Local Market Liquidity (35%)** - How easy is it to buy/sell?
2. **Macro Liquidity Alignment (40%)** - Does it benefit from economic tailwinds?
3. **Price Momentum (15%)** - Are prices trending up?
4. **Drawdown Risk (10%)** - How much downside protection?

### The Problem

Traditional property metrics ignore two critical questions:

- **"Can I exit when I need to?"** ‚Üí Liquidity risk
- **"Will this catch the next economic wave?"** ‚Üí Cycle timing

MLAPS solves both.

## üî¨ Methodology

### Component Metrics

#### 1. Local Market Liquidity (LML)

```python
LML = (12-month sales √∑ dwelling stock) √ó 100
```

**Interpretation:** Percentage of properties that turnover annually

- **Higher** = More liquid, easier to buy/sell
- **Lower** = Illiquid, risk of getting trapped

#### 2. Price Momentum (MOM)

```python
MOM = Annualized growth rate (recent vs historical median prices)
```

**Interpretation:** Current price trend direction and strength

- **Positive** = Prices rising
- **Negative** = Prices declining

#### 3. Drawdown Risk (DDR)

```python
DDR = Maximum peak-to-trough price decline (%)
```

**Interpretation:** Downside risk exposure in corrections

- **Less negative** = More stable, lower risk
- **More negative** = Volatile, higher downside

#### 4. Macro Liquidity Alignment (MLA)

```python
MLA = Correlation(local price returns, global liquidity proxy with 10-week lead)
```

**Interpretation:** Sensitivity to global economic cycles

- **Positive** = Benefits from QE/expansion periods
- **Negative/Zero** = Disconnected or contrarian

### Composite Formula

```python
MLAPS = (0.40 √ó MLA_score) +
        (0.35 √ó LML_score) +
        (0.15 √ó MOM_score) +
        (0.10 √ó DDR_score)
```

Each component normalized to 0-100 scale before weighting.

## üí° For Investors

### Use MLAPS to:

‚úÖ **Shortlist suburbs** for further property-specific research  
‚úÖ **Compare opportunity/risk** profiles across markets  
‚úÖ **Time macro cycles** - buy high-MLA areas during liquidity expansion  
‚úÖ **Avoid liquidity traps** - focus on suburbs with healthy turnover

### Don't use MLAPS to:

‚ùå Make property-specific purchase decisions (needs due diligence)  
‚ùå Short-term trade (designed for medium-term investment horizon)  
‚ùå Replace professional advice (supplement, not substitute)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Assumptions

### Data Constraints

- Minimum 10 transactions required (excludes low-volume suburbs)
- 5,576 total sales (2002-2025) across 16 Sydney suburbs
- Only 6 suburbs had sufficient data for complete analysis

### Assumptions

- GNAF represents total dwelling stock accurately
- Macro liquidity leads property prices by ~10 weeks (literature-based)
- Historical correlation patterns provide guidance for future trends
- Quarterly price aggregation smooths transaction noise adequately

### Caveats

- Macro proxy is synthetic (production would use real BTC/Global M2)
- Correlations are time-varying (treat as context, not trading signals)
- No property-type segmentation (houses vs units)
- Local factors (rezoning, infrastructure) not captured

## üèÜ Why MLAPS?

> _"Traditional metrics tell you where prices have been. MLAPS tells you where liquidity, momentum, risk, and macro conditions align for your next opportunity."_

**The Bottom Line:** MLAPS helps investors find properties they can actually profit from‚Äînot just on paper, but in practice, with:

- ‚úÖ Clear exit paths (liquidity)
- ‚úÖ Favorable entry timing (momentum)
- ‚úÖ Downside protection (risk)
- ‚úÖ Economic tailwinds (macro alignment)
